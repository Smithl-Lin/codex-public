# AMANI Project

## Baseline Rule

All project tasks follow `law1` by default:
- `LAW1_AMANI_AUDIT_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `AUDIT_PLAN.md`

`law1` is the mandatory execution workflow for audit, fix, QA, compliance review, and final merge.

All completed tasks also follow `law2`:
- `LAW2_WORKLOG_POLICY.md`
- Worklog output folder: `20260211/`
