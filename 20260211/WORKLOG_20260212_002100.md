# WORKLOG_20260212_002100 (law2)

## Objective
Execute vision remediation tasks in strict priority order (high -> medium -> low) and synchronize closure artifacts.

## High-Risk Actions
- Added outbound PHI/PII redaction before external API calls in:
  - `20260128/audit_agent.py`
  - `20260128/debug_api.py`
  - `20260128/forensic_debug.py`
- Added redaction logging for traceability.

## Medium-Risk Actions
- Replaced silent fallback branches with explicit warning logs in:
  - `20260128/amani_trinity_bridge.py`
  - `20260128/amah_centurion_injection.py`
- Replaced placeholder init pass with explicit initialization state in:
  - `20260128/amani_global_nexus_v4.py`

## Low-Risk Actions
- Converted low-risk silent preload/config failures to warning logs in:
  - `20260128/amani_nexus_layer_v3.py`
  - `20260128/app.py`
  - `20260128/app_v4.py`

## Validation
- AST parse check passed for changed files:
  - remediation batch: 9/9

## Artifact Sync
- Updated:
  - `TASK_BOARD.md`
  - `QA_REPORT.md`
  - `FINAL_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md`
  - `AMANI_EMPIRICAL_AUDIT_REPORT_VISION_20260212.md`

## Notes
- UTF-8 BOM issue introduced by initial file rewrite was corrected; final files validated via AST.
- Remaining strategic gaps kept explicit: `AMANI_MASTER_ASSET_DB_vFinal.csv` code callchain and standard 24h cron/task scheduler are still Not Found in Source.
