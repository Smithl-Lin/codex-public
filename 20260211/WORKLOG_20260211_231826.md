# WORKLOG_20260211_231826

- Task ID: VISION-RECON-001
- Task Name: Reconstruct AMANI software conception and system goals from Medical Res assets
- Owner: Codex
- Start time: 2026-02-11 22:45:00
- End time: 2026-02-11 23:18:26

## Objective
Audit `C:\2025-12-01 Mayo-working\2026-01-22 Business projects\2026-01-11 Medical Res` and produce a unified AMANI product vision/spec with chronological inheritance and conflict flags.

## Changes
- Files changed:
  - `AMANI_Unified_Vision.md`
  - `20260211/WORKLOG_20260211_231826.md`
- Summary of edits:
  - Built chronological reconstruction using file mtime and in-doc signals.
  - Prioritized files with `Architecture/Draft/Logic/Final`.
  - Consolidated product positioning, OKRs, architecture blueprint, technical consensus, and conflict points requiring manual arbitration.

## Commands Executed
1. `Get-Location`
2. `Get-ChildItem -Force` on target path and project root
3. Recursive file inventory and keyword-priority listing
4. Python-based docx text extraction and signal mining
5. Targeted content extraction from architecture and execution summary documents
6. Data cardinality checks in `20260128` key JSON assets

## Validation
- Result: Passed
- Evidence:
  - Output file exists: `AMANI_Unified_Vision.md`
  - Output includes requested sections:
    - `[Executive Summary]`
    - `[Product Evolution]`
    - `[The Blueprint]`
    - `[Critical Gaps]`

## Risks / Follow-up
1. Several conflict points require human arbitration before converting this blueprint into release-grade PRD.
2. Compliance and model-policy documents remain missing as enforceable implementation specs.
