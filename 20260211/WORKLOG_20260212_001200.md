# WORKLOG_20260212_001200 (law2)

## Objective
Close remaining Phase-1/Phase-2 pending items and align QA evidence with current executable state.

## Actions
- Re-validated deterministic QA command: `python 20260128/qa_deterministic_check.py`.
- Re-ran prerequisites and full pipeline tests:
  - `python 20260128/verify_prerequisites.py`
  - `python 20260128/test_trinity_full_pipeline.py`
- Verified running Streamlit service health:
  - `netstat -ano | Select-String :8501`
  - `Invoke-WebRequest http://127.0.0.1:8501`
- Updated `QA_REPORT.md` from outdated outstanding failures to current closeout results.

## Results
- Deterministic QA: PASS (`QA_DETERMINISTIC_OK`)
- Prerequisites: PASS (`7/7`) with non-blocking Python 3.14 + ChromaDB advisory.
- Full Trinity pipeline: PASS (`4/4`)
- Streamlit endpoint: healthy (`200`)

## Governance
- Workflow followed: `law1` + `law2`
- No destructive operations executed.
