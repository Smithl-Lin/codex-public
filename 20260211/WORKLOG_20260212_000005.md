# Worklog

## 1. Task ID / Task Name
- Task ID: TASK-1
- Task Name: End-to-end and key-chain regression execution

## 2. Objective
- Run requested regression commands and capture objective outcomes.

## 3. Files changed
- `QA_REPORT.md`

## 4. Commands executed
- `python verify_prerequisites.py`
- `python test_trinity_full_pipeline.py`
- `python run_trinity_oncology_case.py`

## 5. Test/validation results
- `verify_prerequisites.py`: failed on ChromaDB/Pydantic + Python 3.14 compatibility.
- `test_trinity_full_pipeline.py`: 1/4 pass; 3 cases intercepted by current strict L1 variance gate.
- `run_trinity_oncology_case.py`: default path intercepted at L1; relaxed-variance demo path completed.

## 6. Risks / follow-up items
- Need environment pinning or dependency patch for ChromaDB under Python 3.14.
- Need product decision whether L1 variance threshold should stay strict in tests.

## 7. Completion time
- 2026-02-12 (local session)
